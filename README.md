# YtTranscriptExtracter
Small project to pull all captions out by a keyword for all youtube videos on a specific channel

Clunky for now, but given a link to a youtube channel, this script will get all video links from that channel, store them in a json file. 
Then for each link it will get through the transcripts for that video and return all captions containing a specified search term.
